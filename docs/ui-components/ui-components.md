Practica (assessments) are 10-minute blocks that are intended for students who want to get assessed on their learning
objectives for their next rank. Students can reserve a spot in this class for dedicated 1-on-1 time with an instructor.

To reserve a spot you must use MindBody, the software that manages our sign-in and customer account management.

There are two ways that to reserve a spot using MindBody: using the mobile app or using your a web browser.
Note that, regardless of which option you use, you must still sign-in to “Practica | assessments” on our iPads.

**Note**: you must have a MindBody account to access the system. If you have not created an account yourself please speak
to our staff to get your login and set a temporary password.
