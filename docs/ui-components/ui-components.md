## Introduction

objectives for their next rank. Students can reserve a spot in this class for dedicated 1-on-1 time with an instructor.

To reserve a spot you must use MindBody, the software that manages our sign-in and customer account management.

Note that, regardless of which option you use, you must still sign-in to “Practica | assessments” on our iPads.
