This procedure will outline how to substitute an instructor for your class. 

Following the procedure will ensure that:
- the Academie Duello management team is aware of who is scheduled to teach what, and
- substituting instructors are fully advised of what they are teaching and when.

Substitutions are made via the MindBody Business mobile app.

### Before you begin
Make sure the MindBody business app is installed on your phone and/or tablet.
You can obtain it from the the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindbodyonline.express&hl=en) or the [Apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindbody-business/id599125654).

## Making the substitution

**Note**: ensure your substitute has agreed to the substitution before applying this procedure.

1. Select either the **My Schedule** or **All staff**  option from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.  
<br>This will bring up the class instructor and who is scheduled to teach. For least amount of clutter, select **My schedule**. <br>

2. Scroll left/right on the dates to the appropriate date.

7. Check the **Email teachers** box.
MindBody will automatically send an e-mail to both you and the substitute instructor with the details of the substitution
including the date, time, and class.
**Note**: ensure that the 'Email teachers' box _is checked_. If you do not the substitution will be recorded but the instructor will not be notified.<br><br>

The substitution is complete. Both instructors will receive e-mails outlining the substitution and the substituting instructor will appear in MindBody.
