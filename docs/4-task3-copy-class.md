**Disruption potential**: high

Periodically, a large group of existing events need to be created with different dates. Creating each course individually
represents an enormous amount of work. For example, every month has five beginner courses, each with eight options. With
the exception of start and end dates, these options are the same for every month.

MindBody has a solution: block copying. This feature will copy a specified-set of events. All the specifics of the event will be copied, dramatically reducing the effort and potential for error.

This procedure will outline how to block copy the weekday fundamentals courses for one curriculum month.

## Block copy steps

1. Login to the [Academie Duello MindBody page](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/LoginLaunch?studioid=154406) using staff credentials. <br><br>
2. From the main page click on **Manager Tools**.  
MindBody employs several levels of permissions. Speak to your administrator if you are missing options.<br><br>

    1. Select the Sunday of the week that you want to copy from.
    2. Un-check S(unday) and S(aturday) from **Days of Week to Copy**.

    4. Check **Copy assigned pricing options**.<br><br>
6. Select the appropriate options in **Date range to copy TO**. <br><br>
    1. Choose the _first Monday_ of the curriculum month that you want to copy _to_ in "New start date for classes".
    2. Choose the _last Friday_ of the curriculum month that you want to copy _to_ in "New end date for classes". <br><br>

7. Click **preview**.
 MindBody will show you the results of your options.  
 Review and change options as needed.<br><br>
8. Click *execute* to create the classes.
 
 The classes will be created in MindBody and added to the schedule.
 
## Confirm the schedule
 
 It is important to verify that the block copy created the schedule you wanted _immediately after_ executing the copy.
 The copied courses will be _open_ for registration; verification will avoid embarrassment and angry customers.

1. Navigate to the class schedules.
    1. Click on **Services and pricing**.<br><br>
    ![](http://github.com/clintonbf/Lynns-and-Clints-doc-project/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/block-copy-confirm-1.png?raw=true)<br><br>
    2. Click **Enrollments**.
    3. Click **# schedules** beside one of the fundamentals courses.  
    This example verifies 'Rapier Fundamentals'.<br><br>
    ![](http://github.com/clintonbf/Lynns-and-Clints-doc-project/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/block-copy-confirm-2.png?raw=true)<br><br>
2. Check each line for the correct details.

## If the class details are incorrect

If the block copy fails, the simplest option may be to delete the new classes and do another block copy.

In order to delete an event:
1. Mouse-over the events' details. 
A garbage can will appear to the left of the event details.<br><br>
2. Click the **garbage can** icon.<br><br>
![](http://github.com/clintonbf/Lynns-and-Clints-doc-project/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/block-copy-delete-1.png?raw=true)<br><br>
3. Confirm deletion.

The class will be deleted from the schedule.
