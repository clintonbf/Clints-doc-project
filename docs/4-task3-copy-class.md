**Disruption potential**: very high

Towards the end of each year we create the next year's schedule of beginner classes.

Creating each class individually represents an enormous amount of work. Each month has five beginner classes, each with eight options. With the exception of start and end dates, these options are the same for every month.

MindBody has a solution: block copying classes. This feature will copy a specified-set of classes. All the specifics of the class will be copied, dramatically reducing the effort and potential for error.

Block copying is (currently) limited to the web-based version of MindBody.

This procedure will outline how to block copy the weekday fundamentals programs for one curriculum month.

### Cautions

- The block copy feature is powerful but not without its pitfalls. There are limitations upon what the feature will allow and Academie Duello's schedule is not 100% compatible.

- Users are strongly encouraged to:
    - follow the instructions carefully _without deviating_ from them,
    - limit block copies to one _curriculum_ month at a time, and
    - _verify_ that the block copy operated as intended.

- MindBody is permissions-restricted; speak to your administrator if you are missing some of the options.

## Block copy steps

1. Login to the [Academie Duello MindBody page](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/LoginLaunch?studioid=154406) using staff credentials.
2. From the main page click on 'Manager Tools'.  
MindBody employs several levels of permissions. Speak to your administrator if you are missing options.
3. Click on the 'Settings' drop-down and then on 'Manage Schedules'.
4. Click 'Block Copy Class Schedules'.
5. Select the appropriate options in 'Options to copy FROM'.
    1. Select the Sunday of the week that you want to copy from.
    2. Un-check S(unday) and S(aturday) from 'Days of Week to Copy'. 
    3. Select 'Beginner courses' from 'Select service categories to copy'.
    4. Check 'Copy assigned pricing options'.
6. Select the appropriate options in 'Date range to copy TO'.
    1. Choose the **first Monday** of the curriculum month that you want to copy **to** in 'New start date for classes'.
    2. Choose the **last Friday** of the curriculum month that you want to copy **to** in 'New end date for classes'.
 7. Click 'preview'.  
 MindBody will show you the results of your options.  
 Review and change options as needed.
 8. Click 'execute' to create the classes.
 
 The classes will be created in MindBody.
 
## Confirm the schedule
 
 It is important to verify that the block copy created the schedule you wanted _immediately after_ executing the copy.
 The copied classes will be open for registration; verifying will avoid embarrassment and angry customers.

1. Navigate to the class schedules.
    1. Click on 'Services and pricing'.
    2. Click on 'Enrollments'.
    3. Click on 'X schedules' beside one of the fundamentals courses.  
    This example investigates 'Rapier Fundamentals'.
2. Check each line for the correct details.

## If the class details are incorrect

If the block copy fails, the simplest option may be to delete the new classes and do another block copy.

In order to delete a class:
1. Mouse-over the class' details.  
A garbage can will appear to the left of the class details.
2. Click the garbage can icon.
3. Confirm deletion.

The class will be deleted from the schedule.
