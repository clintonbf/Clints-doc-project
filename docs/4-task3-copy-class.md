**Disruption potential**: very high

Towards the end of each year we create the next year's schedule of beginner courses.

Creating each course individually represents an enormous amount of work. Each month has five beginner course, each with eight options. With the exception of start and end dates, these options are the same for every month.

MindBody has a solution: block copying. This feature will copy a specified-set of events. All the specifics of the event will be copied, dramatically reducing the effort and potential for error.

Block copying is (currently) limited to the web-based version of MindBody.

This procedure will outline how to block copy the weekday fundamentals courses for one curriculum month.

### Cautions

- The block copy feature is powerful but not without its pitfalls. There are limitations upon what the feature will allow and Academie Duello's schedule is not 100% compatible.

- Users are strongly encouraged to:
    - follow the instructions carefully _without deviating_ from them,
    - limit block copies to one _curriculum_ month at a time, and
    - _verify_ that the block copy operated as intended.

- MindBody is permissions-restricted; speak to your administrator if you are missing some of the options.

## Block copy steps

1. Login to the [Academie Duello MindBody page](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/LoginLaunch?studioid=154406) using staff credentials. <br><br>
2. From the main page click on **Manager Tools**. 
MindBody employs several levels of permissions. Speak to your administrator if you are missing options.<br>

    1. Choose the _first Monday_ of the curriculum month that you want to copy _to_ in **New start date for classe**'.
    2. Choose the _last Friday_ of the curriculum month that you want to copy _to_ in **New end date for classes**. <br>
 7. Click **preview**.
 MindBody will show you the results of your options.  
 Review and change options as needed. <br>
 8. Click *execute* to create the classes.
 
 The classes will be created in MindBody and added to the schedule.
 
## Confirm the schedule
 
 It is important to verify that the block copy created the schedule you wanted _immediately after_ executing the copy.
 The copied courses will be _open_ for registration; verifying will avoid embarrassment and angry customers.

1. Navigate to the class schedules.
    1. Click on **Services and pricing**.
    ![](http://github.com/clintonbf/Lynns-and-Clints-doc-project/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/block-copy-confirm-1.png?raw=true)    2. Click on 'Enrollments'.
    3. Click on **X schedules** beside one of the fundamentals courses.
    This example investigates 'Rapier Fundamentals'.
    ![](http://github.com/clintonbf/Lynns-and-Clints-doc-project/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/block-copy-confirm-2.png?raw=true)
2. Check each line for the correct details.

## If the class details are incorrect

If the block copy fails, the simplest option may be to delete the new classes and do another block copy.

In order to delete an event:
1. Mouse-over the events' details.  
A garbage can will appear to the left of the event details.
2. Click the **garbage can** icon.

3. Confirm deletion.

The class will be deleted from the schedule.
