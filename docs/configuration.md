## Introduction
This procedure will outline how to substitute an instructor for your class.

Substitions are done using MindBody Business mobile app.

**Note**: ensure your substitute has confirmed their availability prior to making the substitution in MindBody.

## Making the substitution

### Before you begin
Make sure the MindBody business app is installed on your phone.
You can obtain it from the the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindbodyonline.express&hl=en) or the [Apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindbody-business/id599125654)

1. Select either the 'My Schedule' or 'All staff'  option from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.
2. Scroll left/right on the dates to the date in question.
3. Tap on the class needing the substitution.
4. In the top-right corner tap on the 3 vertical-dots.
5. Tap 'substitute teacher'.
6. Navigate to the substitute instructor.
7. Check the 'Email teachers' box.

MindBody will automatically send an e-mail to both you and the substitute instructor with the details of the substitution
including the date, time, and class.

**Note**: ensure that the 'Email teachers' box is checked. If you do not the substitution will be recorded but the instructor will not be notified.
 
8. Tap 'substitute'.

## _I forgot to click the 'Email teachers' box!_

If the happens then send an email to the instructor with the details of the substitution:
- date,
- time, and
- class.
