This procedure will outline how to substitute an instructor for your class. 

Following the procedure will ensure that:
- the Academie Duello management team is aware of who is scheduled to teach what, and
- substituting instructors are fully advised of what they are teaching and when

Substitutions are done using MindBody Business mobile app.

### Before you begin
Make sure the MindBody business app is installed on your phone.
You can obtain it from the the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindbodyonline.express&hl=en) or the [Apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindbody-business/id599125654)

## Making the substitution

**Note**: ensure your substitute has consented to substituting prior to making the substitution in MindBody.

1. Select either the 'My Schedule' or 'All staff'  option from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.
2. Scroll left/right on the dates to the date in question.
3. Tap on the class needing the substitution.
4. In the top-right corner tap on the 3 vertical-dots.
5. Tap 'substitute teacher'.
6. Navigate to the substitute instructor.
7. Check the 'Email teachers' box.

MindBody will automatically send an e-mail to both you and the substitute instructor with the details of the substitution
including the date, time, and class.

**Note**: ensure that the 'Email teachers' box _is checked_. If you do not the substitution will be recorded but the instructor will not be notified.
 
8. Tap 'substitute'.

The substitution is complete. Both instructors will receive e-mails outlining the substitution and the substituting instructor will appear in MindBody. 

### _I forgot to click the 'Email teachers' box!_

If the happens then send an email to the instructor with the details of the substitution:
- date,
- time, and
- class.
