This procedure outlines how to create a new instance of a service category to the schedule. 
This document assumes that the service category exists.

This procedure will use the example of adding an instance of Knight camp to the schedule.

4. After the last instance, click **Add a schedule**.

5. Set your options.  
Setting the online capacity to be less than the total capacity can be used to set a soft limit that can be exceeded at the discretion of staff.
6. Click **Schedule Enrollment** to add the enrollment to the schedule.  
You'll be taken back to the screen shown in step 3. 
The enrollment is on the schedule but registrations but pricing must be set before registration can occur.
7. Click on **Add pricing** on the far right of the newly added event.

8. Select the pricing option to add from the drop-down box. Click **Assign**.
