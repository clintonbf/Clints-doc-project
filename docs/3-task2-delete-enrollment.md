**Disruption potential**: very high  
This procedure outlines how to delete an enrollment from the schedule.
 
**Caution**: deleting an enrollment with registrants can be disastrous. Be extremely careful.

This procedure will use the example of removing an instance of Knight camp from the schedule.

2. On the top menu, Click **Services and Pricing**, then **Enrollments** on the left <br><br>

To delete beginner courses click **Intro courses**.  
**Caution**: deviating from Step 6 may create unusual results. MindBody allows multiple ways to select dates but they are not all equivalent.  
**Caution**: be sure to navigate to the _first day_ of the event.
6. Navigate to the first day of the event noted in step 4 using the calendar icon. <br><br>

7. Click **Sign In(X/Y)** on the far left for the event needing deletion.  
X & Y will vary depending on how many registrants there are and the capacity of the event.  
The class roster with contact information will be displayed.  
If the number of registrants in the event is zero you may skip to step 11. <br><br>

**Note**: Note both the full name _and_ email address.<br><br>
8. Record the full name and email address for each registrant on a piece of paper.  
This data will uniquely identify a customer (some customers may have the same full name).<br><br>

**Caution**: be sure you are on the first date of the event, as selected in step 6.<br><br>
10. Click the **X** beside each name. 
The customers will be removed from the date chosen and every subsequent date in the event.<br><br>
[<img src="http://github.com/clintonbf/Lynns-and-Clints-doc-project/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/delete-event-10.png?raw=true" />](http://github.com/clintonbf/Lynns-and-Clints-doc-project/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/delete-event-10.png)<br><br> 
The roster for the event is now empty and the event can be safely deleted.<br><br>
11. Follow steps 1 - 3 to return to the list of scheduled events for that type of Enrollment.<br><br>
12. Mouse-over the class's details.  
A garbage can will appear to the left of the class details.<br><br>
13. Click the **garbage can** icon.<br><br>
