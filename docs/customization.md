Towards year's-end the business needs to create the next year's schedule of beginner classes.

Because each month has 5 beginner classes starting up, and the variations are few, manually creating class represents an enormous amount of work.

Fortunately MindBody offers a reasonable solution: block-copying classes. This feature will allow you copy a set of classes over a period time, dramatically reducing the effort and tedium.
Block-copying is (currently) limited to the web-based version of MindBody.

This procedure will outline how to copy the weekday fundamentals programs for one curriculum month.

### Cautions

The block copy feature is powerful but not without its own pitfalls. There are limitations upon what the system will allow and Academie Duello's schedule is not 100% compatible with the feature.

Users are strongly encouraged to:
- follow the instructions carefully _without deviating_ from them,
- limit block copies to one _curriculum_ month at a time, and
- _verify_ that the block copy operated as intended.

MindBody is permissions-restricted; speak to your administrator if you are missing some of the options.

## Creating the block copy

1. Login to the [Academie Duello MindBody page](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/LoginLaunch?studioid=154406) using staff credentials
2. From the main page click on 'Manager Tools'
MindBody employs several levels of permissions. Speak to your administrator if you are missing options
3. Click on the 'Settings' drop-down and then on 'Manage Schedules
4. Click 'Block Copy Class Schedules'
5. Select the appropriate options in 'Options to copy FROM'
  - select the Sunday of the week that you want to copy
  - from 'Days of Week to Copy', un-check S(unday) and S(aturday)
  - From 'Select service categories to copy', select 'Beginner courses'
  - Check 'Copy assigned pricing options'
6. Select the appropriate options in Date range to copy TO'
  - Choose the first Monday of the curriculum month that you want to copy to in 'New start date for classes'
  - Choose the last Friday of the curriculum month that you want to copy to in 'New end date for classes'
 7. Click 'preview'
 MindBody will show you the results of your options. Review and change as needed
 8. Click 'execute' to create the classes
 
 The classes will be created.
 
 ## Confirm the copy
 
 It is important to verify your block copy operated as intended immediately after creating them.
 Customers will be able to register for the courses; verifying will avoid embarrassment and angry customers.

1. Click on 'Services and pricing', then on 'Enrollments', then on 'X schedules' beside one of the fundamentals courses
This example investigates Rapier Fundamentals.
2. Check each line for the correct dates, instructor, days of the week, time, and prices.

## If the new classes' details are not correct

If the block copy fails, the simplest option may be to delete the new classes and do another block copy.

In order to delete a class:
1. Mouse-over the class' details.
A garbage can will appear to the left of the class details.
2. Click the garbage can.
3. Confirm deletion.

The class will be deleted from the schedule.
