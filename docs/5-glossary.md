### Class

A class is a service that occurs regularly (eg. every Wednesday at 8:30 am). Classes are long-term events typically without end dates or end dates that are far in the future. 

Examples of classes at Academie Duello are: Mastery class, SwordFit, and Youth class.

### Curriculum month
Curriculum months start on the Monday of the first 'full week' of the calendar month and go for four full weeks.

We divide our months into 4-week blocks that completely encompass a calendar month.
For example: April 1, 2020 falls on a Wednesday and April 30 falls on a Thursday. The curriculum month starts on Monday, April 6 and ends on Sunday, April 26.
 
### Enrollment

An enrollment is a service that occurs over a fixed period of time and has a set class cap.
At Academie Duello beginner courses and workshops are enrollments.

Examples of enrollments at Academie Duello are: "Rapier Fundamentals" (a beginner course), "Time And Relative Defense In Swordplay: Fabris' Book 2" (a workshop), and "Knight Camp" (a course).

### Service

Services in MindBody are categorized into a several sub-categories, generally corresponding to the business model of the organization using MindBody.

The sub-categories for service are:
- class,
- enrollment, and
- appointment.

In many cases all options are available to a sub-category, making the distinction technically meaningless.
