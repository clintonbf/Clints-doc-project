### You cannot log in to the the staff side of MindBody.

Ensure that your login is for a staff account and not a customer account

### You have logged in as staff but are missing options.

Check with your administrator that you have the specific permissions needed to see the options you are interested in.

### You see strange results after a block copy operation.

If there are a small amount of errors you can go into each event and correct them. Otherwise, delete the copied events and try the block copy again.

### I deleted the wrong event!

There is no way to retrieve it, unfortunately. It will need to be re-created.

### I made a mistake when I created an event.

Navigate to the event's location (e.g. **Services and Pricing** --> **Enrollments** --> Rapier Fundamentals) and click on that event's dates.  
You can edit the details there.
