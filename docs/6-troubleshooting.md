### You can't log in to the the staff side of MindBody.

Ensure that your login is for a staff account and not a customer account

### You've logged in as staff but are missing options.

Check with your administrator that you have the specific permissions needed to see the options you are interested in.

### You have checked the 'Email instructor' box when making a substitution but the substitute didn't receive an email.

Have the substitute instructor check their spam folder. Also ensure that the email listed in their account is correct.

### You see strange results after a block copy operation.

If there is a small amount of errors you can go into each event and correct them. Otherwise, delete each event with wrong details and try the block copy again.

### Your class schedule isn't visible on the MindBody mobile app.

Clear the app and re-open it.
