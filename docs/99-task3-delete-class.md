**Caution**: deviating from Step 6 may create unusual results. MindBody allows multiple ways to select dates but they are not all equivalent.
**Caution**: be sure to navigate to the first day of the event rather than any date that event occurs on.
6. Navigate to the first day of the event noted in step 4 using the calendar icon.

7. Click **Sign In(X/Y)** on the far left for the event needing deletion.  
X & Y will vary depending on how many registrants there are and the capacity of the event.
