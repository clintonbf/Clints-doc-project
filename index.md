## About _MindBody_

[MindBody](http://mindbody.io) is a customer-management software (CMS) for wellness and fitness businesses (e.g. yoga studios, gyms, etc.).

The software is used to manage class schedules, customer accounts, and retail store.

This document is intended for Academie Duello staff members who need to configure and manage MindBody. All instructions require a staff account with appropriate permissions.

It assumes that the reader is familiar with MindBody's back-end structure, though each procedure will vary in the the requisite knowledge.  
Procedures with higher levels of disruption require more knowledge and permissions.

The procedures are intended to provide the most concise, clear, and correct way to use the software in order to maximize the benefit to Academie Duello and its customers.

### Typographic conventions

Items to click or tap on are preceded by the word "click" or "tap" and are **bolded**  
e.g. "Tap **View Schedule**."  
e.g. "Click **Block Copy Class Schedules**."

### Special notes and cautions

#### Follow the instructions
Depending on the task, MindBody may offer several ways to ostensibly do the same thing. Not all of these methods yield the same result and can cause confusion.  
Readers are encouraged to follow the written instructions: they are known to work.

#### Know the risks!
Changes made to services, prices, customer accounts, etc. in MindBody take _immediate effect_.
  
Be very cautious before executing changes that have significant impact.Each procedure has the potential level of disruption to the business if mis-used.

Each procedure indicates the potential level of disruption to the business (none to very high).
